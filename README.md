## Description
- This is a back-end application that provides API routes to create, read, update, and delete records in a database.
- It enables the management of e-commerce websites where there are multiple products with tags associated with each of them. Also, each product belongs to a specific category.
- This application is built with node.js, express, and sequelize. It communicates with a MySQL database to manage categories, products, and tags, ensuring users can effectively manage their e-commerce store's inventory.

## Usage
- Users must run npm install to install the required dependencies and set up the environment variables by creating a .env file
at the root of the project.
- Users must open MySQL shell, run source db/schema.sql to create the database and run npm run seed to seed the database with sample data.
- Users must run npm start or node server.js to start the application to make requests to the defined api endpoints.
- Users can use Insomnia for testing the api endpoints.
